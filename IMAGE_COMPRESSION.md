# WebP Image Conversion & Compression

## Overview
This project now includes automatic WebP conversion and compression for product images. Images are automatically converted from JPEG/PNG to WebP format with optimized compression settings for the best balance of quality and file size.

## Features

### WebP Conversion
- **Automatic format conversion**: JPEG/PNG â†’ WebP
- **Smart compression**: 70-80% quality (adaptive based on file size)
- **Consistent sizing**: Max 1200px width for optimal display
- **Quality preservation**: Maintains excellent visual quality
- **File size optimization**: Typically 25-35% smaller than JPEG

### Compression Settings

| File Size | Quality | Max Size | Max Width | Format |
|-----------|---------|----------|-----------|--------|
| > 2MB | 70% | 1.0MB | 1200px | WebP |
| 1-2MB | 75% | 800KB | 1200px | WebP |
| < 1MB | 80% | 600KB | 1200px | WebP |

### User Experience
- Real-time WebP conversion progress notifications
- Compression statistics displayed (original vs WebP size)
- Visual indicators showing WebP conversion
- File size information on image previews
- Format conversion indicators

## Implementation Details

### Dependencies
```bash
npm install browser-image-compression
```

### Key Files
- `lib/imageCompression.ts` - WebP conversion utility functions
- `components/ProductForm.tsx` - Updated form with WebP conversion
- `types/browser-image-compression.d.ts` - TypeScript declarations

### Conversion Process
1. User selects JPEG/PNG images (via file input or drag & drop)
2. Images are automatically converted to WebP format
3. WebP images are compressed using smart settings
4. Conversion statistics are calculated and displayed
5. WebP images are stored in component state
6. WebP images are uploaded to Supabase Storage during form submission

### Error Handling
- If conversion fails, original file is used
- User is notified of any conversion errors
- Graceful fallback ensures upload functionality

## Benefits

### For Customers
- **Better image quality** - WebP maintains high quality at smaller sizes
- **Faster loading** - Smaller files load faster
- **Modern format** - WebP is supported by all modern browsers
- **Consistent experience** - All images optimized to 1200px max width

### For Business
- **Lower storage costs** - WebP files are 25-35% smaller
- **Better performance** - Faster page loads
- **Reduced bandwidth** - Less data transfer
- **Professional appearance** - Optimized product images

### Technical Benefits
- **Superior compression** - WebP typically 25-35% smaller than JPEG
- **Quality preservation** - 70-80% quality range maintains excellent visuals
- **Browser support** - WebP supported by all modern browsers
- **Automatic conversion** - No manual intervention required

## Usage

### Basic Usage
The WebP conversion is automatically applied when users upload images through the admin form. No additional configuration is required.

### Supported Formats
- **Input**: JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg), PNG (.png)
- **Output**: WebP (.webp)

### Customizing Conversion
The system uses smart conversion that adapts based on file size. To modify conversion settings, edit the `getAdminCompressionOptions` function in `lib/imageCompression.ts`:

```typescript
export const getAdminCompressionOptions = (originalSize: number): CompressionOptions => {
  const sizeInMB = originalSize / (1024 * 1024)
  
  if (sizeInMB > 2) {
    return {
      maxSizeMB: 1.0,
      maxWidthOrHeight: 1200,
      useWebWorker: true,
      quality: 0.7, // 70% quality for large files
      convertToWebP: true
    }
  } else if (sizeInMB > 1) {
    return {
      maxSizeMB: 0.8,
      maxWidthOrHeight: 1200,
      useWebWorker: true,
      quality: 0.75, // 75% quality for medium files
      convertToWebP: true
    }
  } else {
    return {
      maxSizeMB: 0.6,
      maxWidthOrHeight: 1200,
      useWebWorker: true,
      quality: 0.8, // 80% quality for small files
      convertToWebP: true
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing

You can test the WebP conversion at `/test-env`:
1. Upload a JPEG or PNG image
2. See the WebP conversion results
3. Compare JPEG vs WebP compression
4. View detailed conversion statistics

## File Size vs Quality Balance

| Compression Type | Quality | File Size | Format | Best For |
|------------------|---------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Old (JPEG) | 60% | Small | JPEG | Storage optimization |
| New (WebP) | 70-80% | Smaller | WebP | Quality + compression |
| WebP (High Quality) | 80% | Small-Medium | WebP | Premium products |

## Migration Notes

- All new product uploads will use WebP conversion
- Existing products will retain their current images
- The conversion is applied automatically during upload
- No manual intervention required

## Performance Impact

- **Upload time**: Slightly longer due to WebP conversion
- **Storage**: 25-35% smaller files
- **Loading speed**: Significantly faster due to smaller files
- **User experience**: Better quality and faster loading

## Quality Assurance

The WebP conversion has been tested with:
- Various image types (JPEG, PNG)
- Different file sizes (100KB to 5MB)
- Different image dimensions
- Various content types (jewelry, accessories, etc.)

All tests show significant file size reduction while maintaining excellent visual quality.
